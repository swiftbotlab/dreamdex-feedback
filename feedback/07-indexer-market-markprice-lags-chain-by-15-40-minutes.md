# Indexer `Market.markPrice` (what `listPerpMarkets()` returns) lags the on-chain mark by 15–40 minutes, up to 1.4 %, while the indexer is otherwise at the chain head
Severity: normal
Area: API | docs

`client.listPerpMarkets()` is the documented entry point ("Connect" sample on the developer page) and
its rows carry `markPrice` / `markPriceUpdatedAt` / `indexPrice` from the indexer `Market` table. The
bot kit sizes orders from that field when no live mark is passed (`sizeForNotional` in
`packages/perp-core/src/markets.ts`). On Hideki the row's `markPrice` is refreshed only every
15–40 minutes even though `chain_metadata.latest_processed_block` is within a few blocks of the
head, so `PerpMarket.markPrice` is routinely 10–140 bps away from `PerpPool.tryGetMarkPrice()`.
Nothing on the developer page or in the `PerpMarket` field docs says the row's mark is a slow
snapshot, and `markPriceUpdatedAt` is the only hint.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Query the indexer:
   ```graphql
   query { chain_metadata { latest_processed_block }
           Market(where:{marketType:{_eq:"PERP"}}, limit: 50) { baseSymbol poolAddress markPrice markPriceUpdatedAt } }
   ```
2. For each `poolAddress` call `tryGetMarkPrice()` on the pool (chain head at the same moment).
3. Compare; `node scripts/mark_lag.mjs` does both and prints the table.

## Expected
Either the row's `markPrice` tracks the chain within a few blocks (the indexer is at the head), or the
docs say how often it is refreshed and that sizing/pricing must use `getPerpState` /
`tryGetMarkPrice`.

## Actual
2026-10-19 09:34:49 UTC, chain head 27506743, indexer block 27506737 (6 blocks = 60 ms behind):

| market | chain `tryGetMarkPrice` | indexer `markPrice` | row age | diff |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PUMP | 0.0045272896 | 0.0044658467 | 2367 s | +137.6 bps |
| ZRO | 1.8803751381 | 1.8874262263 | 2359 s | −37.4 bps |

| VVV | 23.838330355 | 23.767396331 | 2365 s | +29.8 bps |
| SUI | 1.0108549502 | 1.0079288032 | 1205 s | +29.0 bps |
| SOL | 105.79768248 | 105.51606645 | 2433 s | +26.7 bps |
| ETH | 2440.1454067 | 2436.0206829 | 931 s | +16.9 bps |
| (all 21 markets) | | | 931–2433 s | 5–138 bps |

A 10 ms-block chain whose indexed mark is 15–40 minutes old is a trap for anyone who reads
"realtime … streamed with zero polling" on the SDK overview and sizes from the row.

## Evidence
- Full 21-row table from `scripts/mark_lag.mjs` (output kept in `evidence/mark_lag.txt`).
- Indexer `chain_metadata` in the same response shows the indexer at the head, so this is the mark
  refresh cadence, not indexer lag.

## Suggested fix
Refresh `Market.markPrice` on every `FundingUpdated`/mark update event (or on a short timer), or
document the cadence on the developer page and in the `PerpMarket.markPrice` field doc with a pointer
to `client.getPerpState(pool)` / `getPerpFeedStatus(pool)` for anything that prices or sizes.
