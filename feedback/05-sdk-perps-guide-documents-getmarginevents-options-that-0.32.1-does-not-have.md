# SDK docs: the Perps guide documents `getMarginEvents` options (`sinceBlock`/`toBlock`, kind `CreditReclaimed`) that 0.32.1 does not accept, so the documented trading-gain recipe silently over-counts
Severity: normal
Area: docs | SDK

The Somnia Markets SDK docs page `/markets/somnia-markets/typescript/perps` ("Account equity for
scoring is one read", also in `llms-full.txt`) gives a competition-scoring recipe that reads flows
between two equity snapshots with

```ts
client.getMarginEvents(account, {
  kinds: ["Deposit", "Credited", "Withdraw", "CreditReclaimed"],
  sinceBlock: start.asOfBlock + 1n, toBlock: end.asOfBlock,
  limit, offset,
})
```

and a table that lists `CreditReclaimed (voucher sweep)` as an `out` flow. In the published SDK
(0.32.1, the version the developer page says the app runs, and also the 0.32.2 canary):

- `GetMarginEventsOptions` has only `kinds`, `limit`, `offset` (src/perp/history.ts:90–104); the
  implementation builds `where` from `account` and `kinds` only (history.ts:657–669). `sinceBlock` /
  `toBlock` are not read, so a JavaScript caller that pastes the recipe gets the account's **whole**
  history, newest first, and `flows` includes deposits made before `start` — the trading gain comes
  out wrong with no error.
- `MarginEventKind` is the closed union `"Deposit" | "Withdraw" | "Locked" | "Unlocked" | "Credited"`
  (history.ts:83, runtime copy at :675). `"CreditReclaimed"` throws
  `InvalidInputError("Margin event kinds must contain only Deposit, Withdraw, Locked, Unlocked, Credited; got CreditReclaimed")`
  (history.ts:697–700), so the recipe as written does not run at all in TypeScript or JavaScript.
- The same page opens with "Perps are live on testnet: `BTC/USDSO:USDSO` and `ETH/USDSO:USDSO`";
  21 perp markets are live (`PerpPoolFactory.perpPoolCount()` = 21).

## Steps to reproduce
1. `npm pack @somnia-chain/markets-sdk@0.32.1` and open `package/src/perp/history.ts`.
2. Read `GetMarginEventsOptions` (lines 90–104), `getMarginEvents` (657–669), `MarginEventKind` (83)
   and `marginEventKindList` (691–704).
3. Compare with the recipe on the docs page (search for `CreditReclaimed` and `sinceBlock` under
   "Account equity for scoring is one read").
4. `grep -rn "sinceBlock" package/src/perp/history.ts` -> no matches (the only `sinceBlock` support in
   the SDK is for orders, `src/orders.ts:255`).

## Expected
The documented options exist, or the docs document the options the shipped SDK has.

## Actual
`sinceBlock`/`toBlock` are ignored by `getMarginEvents`; `CreditReclaimed` is rejected before the
request; the market list sentence is from the two-market era.

## Evidence
- Source lines quoted above (0.32.1 tarball, sha from npm; same in
  `0.32.2-canary.38575926931.ge4550933d36d`).
- `PerpPoolFactory.perpPoolCount()` = 21 at block 27491272 (`scripts/survey.mjs`).

## Suggested fix
Either ship `sinceBlock`/`toBlock` on `getMarginEvents` (the indexer row has no `blockNumber`
field — `field 'blockNumber' not found in type: 'MarginEvent'` — so this needs an indexer column too)
and add `CreditReclaimed` to `MarginEventKind`, or rewrite the recipe to filter by `timestamp` and
the kinds that exist. Update the "live on testnet" sentence to the live market count.
